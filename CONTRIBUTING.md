# Contributing to Remeta
I am very pleased you are interested in contributing to one of my projects!

I have tried to make contributing to Remeta as easy as possible. Below are some guidelines you can use to get started!
If you have any questions about Remeta, or the contributing guidelines please open a thread on GitHub discussions.

## Feature Requests / Ideas

### Creating a feature request
If you have an idea for a feature that you think will benefit Remeta, please create an issue with a detailed explanation of your feature and why you think it will benefit the Remeta project.
Contributing feature ideas can include repository management, licensing, documentation, and, of course, new features to the software.

### Contributing a feature
If you would like to contribute code to creating a feature, please fill in a feature request unless a request is already open for that feature.
Please wait until the feature has been scrutinised, and approved by the maintainer or a collaborator of the project.
Once the go head has been given, a branch will be created, and you may push commits into that branch from a fork.

Once the features is ready, create a pull request from the feature branch into the `dev` branch.
After the code has been reviewed, your commits will be merged and your contributions will be added to the next update of Remeta :beers:.

## Bug Reports

### Creating a bug report
To create a bug report, please use GitHub issues.
It is important to be descriptive and created steps to reproduce the problem. Screenshots/code samples are also appreciated.

### Contributing bug fixes
You should be able to see a list of bug reports in the GitHub issues tab.
If you wish to work on a bug fix, then ping the Remeta maintainer (@hrszpuk) or a collaborator.
They will assign you to the issue and create a branch for you to contribute commits to.

Once complete, open a pull request into the `dev` branch.

Thanks :+1:
